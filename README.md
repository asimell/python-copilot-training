# Copilot Practice With Python

Practice using copilot by implementing a simple Python application.

## Exercise: Create a Flask Application

Your task is to create a Flask application that can parse any form of .csv data and visualize it inside the app. Follow these steps:

1. Set up a new Flask project.
2. Create a route that allows users to upload a .csv file.
    * Sample data can be found from the `data` directory.
3. Parse the uploaded .csv file and store the data.
4. Create a route to visualize the parsed data (e.g., using a table or a chart).

Feel free to explore and utilize GitHub Copilot's features to assist you in writing the code for this exercise. Happy coding!
