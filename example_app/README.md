# Example Flask App

This project folder contains an example application that has been almost entirely generated with GitHub Copilot, including this README file. The purpose of this example app is to demonstrate the capabilities of Copilot in generating code, templates, and other project components.

## Folder Structure

The `example_app` folder is organized as follows:

```bash
example_app/
├── app.py               # The main entry point of the Flask application. It contains the application setup and route definitions.
├── templates/           # A folder containing HTML templates used by the Flask app for rendering views.
├── static/              # A folder for static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
└── requirements.txt     # A file listing the Python dependencies required to run the application.
```
